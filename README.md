# MERN SPA minimal boilerplate

Less fluff than more popular boilerplate projects. (Or maybe just the type of fluff that I can understand)

Use React and React Router on the front-end, and an internal API delivered via Node.js, Express, and Mongoose on the back-end.

Just use `npm i && npm start` to get going.

* React Router v4 handling client routing, Express for server-side routing
* Hot Module Replacement available for client-side changes (i.e., not when you change Express or server-side stuff)
